# DataScienceProject
The system uses OpenCV and OCR to process handwritten prescriptions and lookup medicine info via OpenFDA.
Project Objectives:
•	Enable users to upload or scan handwritten prescriptions for automated text extraction.
•	Train an OCR model (Tesseract and CNN-based OCR) to recognize prescription handwriting.
•	Develop an NLP-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for medicine name and dosage extraction.
•	Integrate OpenFDA API to retrieve detailed medicine information.
•	Ensure data privacy and ethical compliance by anonymizing personal information.
•	Deploy a functional prototype with a user-friendly interface.
